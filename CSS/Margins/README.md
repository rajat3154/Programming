CSS Margins
In web design, margins play a crucial role in defining the spacing around an element. Here, we’ll learn about the essential concepts of CSS margins. Understanding these properties is crucial for creating well-designed web layouts. We’ll cover their definitions, usage, best practices, and examples.

What are Margins?
The CSS margin property allows us to create space around an element. They define the gap between an element and its neighboring elements. Margins can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left).

Margin Values
Length (e.g., px, rem, em, ex, vh, vw, etc)
Percentage (relative to the element’s width)
auto (calculated by the browser)
margin allows negative values.
